## Skill Loading

Before editing files for a substantial task:
- Run `bunx @tanstack/intent@latest list` from the workspace root to see available local skills.
- If a listed skill matches the task, run `bunx @tanstack/intent@latest load <package>#<skill>` before changing files.
- Use the loaded `SKILL.md` guidance while making the change.
- Monorepos: when working across packages, run the skill check from the workspace root and prefer the local skill for the package being changed.
- Multiple matches: prefer the most specific local skill for the package or concern you are changing; load additional skills only when the task spans multiple packages or concerns.

## Package Manager

This workspace uses **bun**.

## Docs

When using third party libraries, use Context7 MCP to look up the docs.

## Quality Gates

Before completing any task, ensure all of the following pass:

1. **Biome** — No formatting errors in modified files
2. **Linter** — No lint errors in the project

## GitHub Copilot Instructions

When generating commit messages, always use the Conventional Commits format:
- Start with a type: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore, perf, ci, build
- Optionally include a scope in parentheses
- Follow with a colon and space, then a lowercase description
- Example: feat(auth): add password reset flow
- Example: fix: resolve null pointer in user hook

# General Guidelines for working with Nx

- For navigating/exploring the workspace, invoke the `nx-workspace` skill first - it has patterns for querying projects, targets, and dependencies
- When running tasks (for example build, lint, test, e2e, etc.), always prefer running the task through `nx` (i.e. `nx run`, `nx run-many`, `nx affected`) instead of using the underlying tooling directly
- Prefix nx commands with the workspace's package manager (e.g., `pnpm nx build`, `npm exec nx test`) - avoids using globally installed CLI
- You have access to the Nx MCP server and its tools, use them to help the user
- For Nx plugin best practices, check `node_modules/@nx/<plugin>/PLUGIN.md`. Not all plugins have this file - proceed without it if unavailable.
- NEVER guess CLI flags - always check nx_docs or `--help` first when unsure

## Scaffolding & Generators

- For scaffolding tasks (creating apps, libs, project structure, setup), ALWAYS invoke the `nx-generate` skill FIRST before exploring or calling MCP tools

## When to use nx_docs

- USE for: advanced config options, unfamiliar flags, migration guides, plugin configuration, edge cases
- DON'T USE for: basic generator syntax (`nx g @nx/react:app`), standard commands, things you already know
- The `nx-generate` skill handles generator discovery internally - don't call nx_docs just to look up generator syntax

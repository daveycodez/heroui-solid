## Skill Loading

Before editing files for a substantial task:
- Run `bunx @tanstack/intent@latest list` from the workspace root to see available local skills.
- If a listed skill matches the task, run `bunx @tanstack/intent@latest load <package>#<skill>` before changing files.
- Use the loaded `SKILL.md` guidance while making the change.
- Monorepos: when working across packages, run the skill check from the workspace root and prefer the local skill for the package being changed.
- Multiple matches: prefer the most specific local skill for the package or concern you are changing; load additional skills only when the task spans multiple packages or concerns.

## Package Manager

This workspace uses **bun**.

## Docs

When using third party libraries, use Context7 MCP to look up the docs.

## Quality Gates

Before completing any task, ensure all of the following pass:

1. **Biome** — No formatting errors in modified files
2. **Linter** — No lint errors in the project

## GitHub Copilot Instructions

When generating commit messages, always use the Conventional Commits format:
- Start with a type: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore, perf, ci, build
- Optionally include a scope in parentheses
- Follow with a colon and space, then a lowercase description
- Example: feat(auth): add password reset flow
- Example: fix: resolve null pointer in user hook

## Component Porting Conventions (packages/heroui-solid)

Mirror the official HeroUI React source as closely as possible, adapting only
what Solid requires. Fetch the source before porting (heroui-react MCP
`get_component_source_code`, or the `v3` branch of heroui-inc/heroui on GitHub).

- **File structure mirrors upstream**: `XRoot` naming, internal `XPrimitive`
  components, the same section banner comments where upstream has them,
  trailing `export {XRoot}` / `export type {XRootProps}`.
- **Match upstream comment density** — which is near zero. No prop JSDoc
  unless the upstream file has it; no explanatory prose. The only allowed
  additions are one-liners guarding a necessary workaround (e.g. the
  single-read children rule), with the full story in AGENTS.md, not the code.
- **index.ts uses the official compound layout**:
  `export const X = Object.assign(XRoot, { Root: XRoot })`, a merged
  `export type X = { Props: ComponentProps<typeof XRoot>; RootProps: ... }`
  (`ComponentProps` from solid-js), named `XRoot` export,
  `XRootProps as XProps` alias, and variants re-exported from `@heroui/styles`.
- **Reuse `@heroui/styles` at runtime — never duplicate styling knowledge**:
  the tv functions (`buttonVariants`), `cn`, and the `XVariants` types are the
  exact code the React implementation uses. No local `*.styles.ts` modules, no
  convenience types upstream doesn't export.
- **`@heroui/styles` is pinned to an exact version (no `^`/`~`)** — classes,
  `variantKeys`, and prop types all come from it at runtime, so bumps must be
  deliberate: update the pin, re-run tests, and re-check docs parity.
- **Variant keys are dynamic**: `splitProps(props, xVariants.variantKeys,
  [/* behavior keys */])` — the tv function exposes its config at runtime.
  Never hardcode a variant key list.
- **Class composition**: `class={cn(xVariants(variantProps), local.class)}`.
- **Behavior**: Kobalte primitives where they add value (our React Aria
  equivalent); `callHandler` from `@kobalte/utils` when intercepting handlers.
  Standard adaptations: `onClick` for `onPress`, Kobalte `as` for React's
  `render` prop, `class` for `className`, `createSignal` for `useState`,
  `splitProps` instead of destructuring (destructuring kills reactivity).
- **Skip what isn't ported yet** (e.g. `BUTTON_GROUP_CHILD` until ButtonGroup
  exists) and React-only machinery (`dom.span`, `composeTwRenderProps`).
- **Never depend on react-aria/`@react-types`, even types-only**: public d.ts
  references force it into consumers' deps (dragging React peer deps into
  Solid apps), and its prop types are React-shaped (`ReactNode`). Write the
  small framework-neutral shapes inline (e.g. `{ isPending: boolean }`).
  Framework-agnostic satellites like `@internationalized/date` are fine as
  real deps when a component needs them.
- **HeroUI CSS state selectors need bridging — audit every port.** Upstream
  CSS keys interactive states off React Aria attributes (`data-focus-visible`,
  `data-hovered`, `data-pressed`, `data-selected`…) that Kobalte doesn't stamp
  (Button stamps only `data-disabled`), and some native fallbacks are dead
  selectors (`:focus-visible:not(:focus)` never matches) — states silently
  no-op (buttons shipped with no focus ring). Grep
  `node_modules/@heroui/styles/dist/components/<x>.css` for `data-` selectors,
  then bridge in a colocated `<x>.overrides.css` (working pseudo-class or
  Kobalte's attrs → `@apply` the same HeroUI utility, e.g.
  `.button:focus-visible { @apply status-focused; }`) registered in the
  `src/styles/overrides.css` barrel with `layer(overrides)`; rebuild with
  `bun run build:css`. `dist/styles.css` is the package's ONLY stylesheet —
  the barrel is imported by `src/styles/styles.css`, never compiled as its own
  entry (a split overrides-only entry was tried and removed; Tailwind
  `@reference` also re-emits the referenced stylesheet when nested under
  another entry's `@import`).

## Solid SSR/Hydration Rules (hard-won — violations cost a full day)

- **Read the `children` prop exactly once per evaluation.** Children are
  create-on-access getters; a bare `typeof props.children` ternary in JSX
  compiles into two reads, creating children twice and desyncing SSR hydration
  keys ("Hydration Mismatch", then "template is not a function" cascades).
  Capture to a local first, or forward via a single-read `get children()` in
  `mergeProps` (see button.tsx).
- **MDX authoring (apps/docs)**: no `import` statements in `.mdx`; no JSX
  children of components written in MDX — multiline children get
  paragraph-wrapped by MDX (`<Button>\nText\n</Button>` becomes
  `<Button><p>Text</p></Button>`) and render-prop children loop children
  resolution. Demos are TSX files in `apps/docs/src/demos/<component>/`,
  registered in `src/demos/index.ts`, rendered via
  `<ComponentPreview name="component-demo" />` (same structure as official
  HeroUI docs; docs page content mirrors the official pages verbatim, adapted
  only for documented API differences).
- **Debugging hydration**: it's diagnosable without a browser — curl the dev
  server and compare `data-hk` key suffixes between SSR HTML and the client's
  expected key from the console error. HMR masks hydration bugs entirely
  (client re-render, no hydration) — always verify with a full page reload.
  The dev-mode "Hydration Mismatch ... Layout.jsx" console error on every page
  is an upstream SolidBase bug; don't confuse it with real breakage.
- **Known wart**: Kobalte's Button stamps `type="button"` on non-button `as`
  elements in SSR HTML (ref-based tag detection can't run server-side); the
  client removes it after mount. Upstream issue, not fixable from our side.

## Dev Loop

- `nx dev docs`: the docs vite config aliases `heroui-solid` to the package
  **source** in dev, so component edits HMR instantly — no package build or
  restart. The one-shot `^build` at startup only provides `dist/styles.css`
  and `.d.ts` for editor types. Package CSS edits need `bun run build:css`
  (or the `dev:css` watcher).
- External projects consuming via `bun link` read `dist/` — run
  `nx dev heroui-solid` (tsup + CSS watchers) for that workflow.
- When checking Biome from scripts, surface the exit code — don't pipe output
  through `tail`/`grep` in a way that swallows failures.

# General Guidelines for working with Nx

- For navigating/exploring the workspace, invoke the `nx-workspace` skill first - it has patterns for querying projects, targets, and dependencies
- When running tasks (for example build, lint, test, e2e, etc.), always prefer running the task through `nx` (i.e. `nx run`, `nx run-many`, `nx affected`) instead of using the underlying tooling directly
- Prefix nx commands with the workspace's package manager (e.g., `pnpm nx build`, `npm exec nx test`) - avoids using globally installed CLI
- You have access to the Nx MCP server and its tools, use them to help the user
- For Nx plugin best practices, check `node_modules/@nx/<plugin>/PLUGIN.md`. Not all plugins have this file - proceed without it if unavailable.
- NEVER guess CLI flags - always check nx_docs or `--help` first when unsure

## Scaffolding & Generators

- For scaffolding tasks (creating apps, libs, project structure, setup), ALWAYS invoke the `nx-generate` skill FIRST before exploring or calling MCP tools

## When to use nx_docs

- USE for: advanced config options, unfamiliar flags, migration guides, plugin configuration, edge cases
- DON'T USE for: basic generator syntax (`nx g @nx/react:app`), standard commands, things you already know
- The `nx-generate` skill handles generator discovery internally - don't call nx_docs just to look up generator syntax
